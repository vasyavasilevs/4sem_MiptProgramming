Let's go back to 1980s!

Words don't come easy to me,
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you,
Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy to me,
This is the only way for me to say
I love you,
Words don't come easy

Well I'm just a music man,
Melody’s so far my best friend,
But my words are calling out longer,
I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you'll believe it's true 'cause

Words don't come easy to me,
How can I find a way to make you see
I love you,
Words don't come easy

This is just a simple song,
That I've made for you on my own,
There's no hidden needing, you know that I
When I say I love you, honey,
Please believe I really do 'cause

Words don't come easy to me,
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you,
Words don't come easy

It isn't easy,
Words don't come easy....

Words don't come easy to me,
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you,
Words don't come easy

Don't come easy to me,
This is the only way
For me to say,
Words don't come easy
